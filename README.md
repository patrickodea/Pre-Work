# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to practice using HTML, CSS, Git, and JS during this project.
- I built this project to show case all my prework notes for the coding bootcamp.
- The project helped fix the layout of a given webpage, and helped me practice basic coding skills. 
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Js and how to combine all languages to create a fully functioning webpage.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

The webpage displays all topics covered in the Pre-Work.  These are identfied as headers on the site.  Under each topic are notes I took to help myself understand each language.  The notes are listed in bullet points for organizational purposes.  In the DevTools console you can see JS running, listing out each topic learned in the Pre-Work.  Refreshing the page will allow you to randomize what topic to learn.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
